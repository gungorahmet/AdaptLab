# Experience Sharing Use Case

A newcomer wants to share some experiences with his/her new colleagues. We will provide an interface to write document and send document to his/her new colleagues via e-mail.
The system will **both** store documents in the database **and** send e-mail. So, newcomer who will join the organization in the future can see these documents.
